## About Us
Marshall-Starke Development Center, Inc. (MSDC) is a Not-for-Profit organization providing comprehensive rehabilitive, vocational, and educational services to developmentally disabled individuals. We also offer high quality preschool education for all children and services for expectant mothers.

### History
Marshall-Starke Development Center, Inc. was formed in 1965 by a small group of concerned and dedicated individuals striving to plan how to provide services and programs for the disadvantaged. Most of these individuals were themselves parents of children with a disability. With the help of the community and corporations, a building fund was established. In October of 1976, Marshall-Starke Development Center opened at 1901 PIDCO Drive in Plymouth.

In 1984, we made application to the federal government to serve as grantee for Head Start in Marshall and Starke counties. We continue today to sponsor the federally funded Head Start and Early Head Start programs which provide the highest quality early childhood services and preschool education for all children 0-5 years of age.

Again with the help of the community and grants we were able to construct Kaleidoscope Childrenâ€™s Center in Plymouth. This facility built in 1992 serves as the home to our Head Start, Early Head Start and Early Childhood Vocational Education programs. By partnering with the North Central Area Vocational Cooperative and  Ivy Tech College our dual credit Early Childhood Vocational Education Program provides instruction and field experience for local high school students aspiring a professional teaching career.

Over the years, quality programs evolved. In June of 1994, Marshall-Starke and the Fulton County ARC, d.b.a., Manitou Center, merged to enhance and expand adult programs and services. In addition in 1995, Marshall-Starke purchased Real Products. This industry is housed in the Marshall-Starke workshop and manufactures wooded reels for the wire industry. While employing traditional workers, Real Products also provides job placement and work opportunities for individuals enrolled in Marshall-Starke programs. Marshall-Starke continued to grow with the addition of the Early Head Start program in 1998. The Early Head Start program provides services to pregnant women, infants/toddlers and families.

Through all of our programs and our continuing dedication to service, Marshall-Starke, Inc. strives to be a viable, marketable asset to the communities and individuals we serve.
