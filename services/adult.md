## Adult Services
Marshall-Starke believes in providing choices for individuals with disabilities. What is right for one person is not necessarily right for another. Our day programming centers on choice.

### Tracks
When an individual begins services, he/she selects one of three programming tracks: Employment, Industrial, or Community Crossroads. Changes of program option can be made at annual case conferences or when the individual desires change. Also, individuals may choose to be enrolled in one program but still participate in another track. What is important is that individuals select the program that best fits their needs and desires.

### Community Living
For people who are looking for a community living program, Marshall-Starke offers Supported Living for qualifying individuals. Providers of services are responsible for the health, safety and welfare of their residents. Marshall-Starke takes this responsibility very seriously, and is diligent in providing quality services necessary to support individuals to live successfully in their own homes.
