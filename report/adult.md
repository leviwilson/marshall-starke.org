<h4 class="subheader" id="supported">SUPPORTED LIVING</h4>
Summer Camp is happening in June this year!  Consumer’s chose Camp Millhouse or Camp Re-Yo-Ad for a week.  In August all consumers interested attended Camp Millhouse with MSDC staff for three days.  Staff and Consumers walked in the Blueberry parade.  Consumers look forward to carnival food and booths to shop.  Residential had their annual Christmas party.  Consumers always enjoy the food, drinks and exchanging gifts.

Residential had two consumers leave the program.  One went to a nursing home for end of life care and another moved back into parents’ home.  Currently all of residential sites are full with happy, healthy individuals.

At the beginning of spring our maintenance man began to do work around the Seven Supported Living Sites.  The homes have been power washed, built and repaired ramps, trimmed trees and bushes, cleaned gutters and completed inside repairs.  This is completed every spring, summer and fall.

Currently this program is short ten staff positions.  Our current staff have been working hard to help fill these shortages.  COVID has caused Havoc since March 2020.  All of our consumers have been nervous about the changes coming.  Consumers and staff started wearing masks, social distancing, washing our hand more frequently and staying home.  Consumers are nervous with all the changes and their parents are also concerned.  Consumers and staff have found been able to enjoy activities like cookouts, walks and friends/peers; playing basketball in the park, board games, rodeo, reading, social media, and watching TV.  Families have been cautious of taking their children home for weekends and holidays due to COVID.  We are all wondering where this is going to take us and how long we need to isolate.  We will be sure to celebrate Direct Support Professional (DSP) week with a lot of fun things.

MSDC is in the 4th year of a four-year contract in which we receive assistance with staff wages from the Establishment Project.  We are grateful that the Establishment Project has helped fund our supported employment program and I am happy to report that we are beginning to see increases in referrals over the past year.

In FY’ 2020, 59 individuals were served in Marshall-Starke Development Center’s Community Employment Services.  The majority of individuals were residents of Marshall and Starke County, followed by Fulton County.
