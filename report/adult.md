<h4 class="subheader" id="supported">SUPPORTED LIVING</h4>
This past year has been filled with many changes. Staffing for the program has been difficult. We have had a shortage of staff for about 2 years. We need at least six (6) staff to fill our current open positions.

The Supported Living consumers made some physical moves last summer and it has worked out well for them. They individually determined what house they would like to move into and who they wanted to live with. Some of them wanted a change of housemates; others were interested in a different more accessible home, so it worked out well for everyone involved.

MSDC sold our supported living site in Rochester last fall and purchased a duplex in Rochester instead. The duplex was renovated and turned into a single family home for our Rochester consumers. It is four (4) bedrooms, 2 handicapped accessible bathrooms, 3 living areas and large kitchen. Consumers moved after the first of the year.

We had six (6) consumers attend different summer camps this past year. All our consumers attended MSDC CAMPOUT at Camp Millhouse last September. This is the first time we used this facility and it was wonderful! Everyone had comfortable sleeping arrangements, great food and activities. Many consumers swam in the pool, enjoyed the campfires and we had community volunteers offering motorcycle rides to anyone interested.

This past year our consumers had a lot of fun doing the things they love. Special Olympics bowling, concerts in the park, Niles Scream Park, Hall of Heroes Comic Con, cookouts, fishing, holiday parties, Theatre, Turkey Tracks Hunt, Shipshewana Ice Sculpture Show, Popcorn Festival, 4H Fairs, MSDC Prom, Night to Shine Prom, Fall Dance, Firemen's Festival in Bremen, Bingo, Showland Theatre, celebrating birthdays, going on dates, Blueberry Festival, Cupcakes and Canvas class at the library, church, touring museums and shopping at the Mall.

Next year we hope to grow as a program and find many more exciting things to do!

<h4 class="subheader" id="crossroads">COMMUNITY CROSSROADS</h4>
In the Community Crossroads Program, we did receive two new vans through the INDOT Grant. It is wonderful to receive these grants, which pays for the cost of two vehicles, less our 20% match.  We did complete an INDOT review which yielded no citations! We also completed our CARF review in May.  We did receive a three year accreditation.  The preparation was grueling but it turned out well for our agency.  We had a successful annual camping trip at Camp Millhouse in South Bend with over 65 overnight guests.  This is the perfect site for our annual three day camping trip and we will continue to rent this property annually. We applied for the Day Program Grant and have been awarded $49,433.10 from the State of Indiana to complete renovations on the consumer restrooms, which is greatly needed.  Our enrollment for Day Program has remained steady.  We do see a trend with consumers requesting more Individual Services and less full-time Day Services.

Manitou Training Center offers a range of community and facility based groups to participate in, as well as individualized services. Currently, 32 consumers are being served. Community volunteer groups are available each day. These give consumers a chance to expand their community knowledge, pre-vocational skills, and a sense of accomplishment in helping their community. Other community groups are focused on community resources where consumers can choose laundry, recycling, supply shopping, exercise, and leisure activities to attend and learn through experiencing and participation.   Facility based groups include a mix of technology classes, basic concepts, pre-vocational, exercise, cooking, music, art, local news, learning about other cultures, social skills, and academic skills for various individualâ€™s needs. Each of these groups are offered on a weekly bases so that consumers are giving an opportunity to explore different interests and expand their knowledge.

In 2018, the exterior of the building was painted with the funds raised from the Non-Event-Event. The landscape around the building was updated and landscape rock installed. Ipads and keyboards were purchased for the technology classes from the Rob Wilson Memorial Fund.

<h4 class="subheader" id="employment">COMMUNITY EMPLOYMENT SERVICES</h4>
It has been a year of changes for Employment Services. With funds from the Establishment Project, we were able to hire a new full-time Employment Consultant. We are ready and waiting for the influx of consumers that is expected in the fall of 2017 with the Vocational Rehabilitation changes to serve people with the most significant disabilities. The influx did not materialize the way it was expected and VR referrals have trickled in. We are grateful that the Establishment Project has helped fund our program through this slower time for referrals.

In Fiscal Year 2017, 57 individuals were served in Marshall-Starke Development Center's Community Employment Services. The majority of individuals were residents of Marshall and Starke Counties, followed by Fulton County. The majority of program participants were in their teens or early twenties, while a small percentage were in their thirties and forties. There was even one in his seventies!

There were 15 individuals placed in jobs this year. Of those individuals twelve ended in successful closures through Vocational Rehabilitation. The three not ending in successful closures either quit or were terminated, one found other employment. Of the fifteen placements this fiscal year thirteen of them were at businesses that had never hired from MSDC's Community Employment Services.
