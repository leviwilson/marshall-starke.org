<h4 class="subheader" id="supported">SUPPORTED LIVING</h4>
Within this year, we gained two new consumers to our Supported Living Program.  One of the new consumers had waited a year to enter our program and they have both become more independent. They are happy to be with us. One consumer left our program due to entering a nursing home and three children whom we gave full time services in their family home chose another provider.

 We hired a new RHS Evening Supervisor in September 2018. This supervisor replaced one that had left. The RHS Supervisor hires and manages the staffing, fills open shifts and attends consumer meetings. We have had much difficulty keeping enough Direct Care Staff to fill all our shifts. Many staff have worked and abundance of overtime to help out. The shortage of staffing has been our biggest concern this year.

MSDC held summer camp at Camp Millhouse this year. It was a good space for everyone. Many consumers were in attendance and had a great time. Some consumers also attended another summer camp of their choice. There was Red Cedar Camp in Fort Wayne, Camp ReYoAd in North Webster and again Camp Millhouse. Most of these consumers received some type of financial assistance to attend for several days. These connections are important and make lifelong friendships.

Consumers have been working on Outcome Measures (goals) to learn more independence. Many have succeeded greatly. Others are more interested in social gatherings, dating and friendships among their peers.  We have been busy with many activities such as: Notre Dame basketball game, Special Olympics, billiards has been a fun new activity, concerts and plays, musicals by Maxinkuckee Singers, fishing, picnics, cookouts, sitting by the fire pit in cool evenings, festivals, 4H Fairs, birthdays and holiday parties,  farmer’s market, swimming, YMCA for exercise, craft opportunities at the libraries, touring breweries and other businesses in our area.

We look forward to another exciting and productive year.

Adult Programs here at MSDC has had another successful year.  Our enrollment remains steady, with an increase over the previous year of 13 consumers, currently serving 184 individuals with disabilities.

Each year, we have several social events for the individuals we serve, a prom in May, a 3-day camping trip, and two fall parties.  There are many outside donors and families that help make these events happy and memorable occasions for those we serve and we truly appreciate their assistance.

Throughout the year, Adult Programs offer a variety of services, such as:  Prevocational, Group Facility, Group Community, Community and Facility Individual, as well as PAC and Respite.  Our consumers are given choices daily of a wide variety of options to fill their day.  Through choice, consumers gain control of their lives as well as the ability to fulfill their wants and needs. Our consumers participate in many meaningful activities with a focus on volunteerism, exercise, social activities and daily living skills.

MSDC’s Rochester site, Manitou Training Center (MTC) offers a full range of services.  MTC is a smaller facility, with an enrollment of 33 individuals.  MTC has also had a slight gain in enrollment over the past year, with an increase of 3 consumers. There are some consumers that appreciate the smaller environment in Rochester, so we do offer transportation to/from Rochester daily for consumers that choose to attend services at MTC.  We do try to meld the consumers from both agencies at times throughout the year, creating one big, happy family!

MSDC is proud to continue to offer piece rate work to our consumers in Pre-vocational Services through our Department of Labor 14C Certificate.  Piece rate work that is obtained from contracted work through area companies is another way to encourage choice for our consumers in earning a paycheck in an environment that they prefer.

We are pleased to be able to provide door-to-door transportation to/from our centers for individuals living in Starke, Marshall and Fulton Counties.  We also offer pick-up-points for those that live outside of those counties.  Many consumers are utilizing those pick-up-points from St. Joseph, LaPorte and Kosciusko counties.  Each year since 2014, MSDC has applied for, and received INDOT grants that pay 80% of the cost of two new vehicles per year.  In the 2019 INDOT Grant, MSDC was awarded 3 new vehicles.  The INDOT grants have made a tremendous improvement in the safety and reliability of our fleet of more than 32 vehicles, all used daily to meet the needs of individuals with disabilities.

MSDC offers Employment Services to individuals with disabilities that are seeking community employment.  Current enrollment in this program is 25 individuals.  Our four Employment Services staff’s goals are to prepare, obtain and retain work for individuals in community jobs.  Most consumers will need on the job supports for a period of time, and then perhaps a small amount of follow-along support after the person is stabilized in a job. In 2016, MSDC applied for, and received the Establishment Project, which is a four-year financial assistance program developed by Vocational Rehabilitation to assist agencies increase the quality, quantity and intensity of employment services.  The finances from the Establishment Project enabled MSDC to promote one employment staff and hire an additional staff for Employment Services.  Since 2016, our enrollment has fluctuated between 20-26 enrollees.  In 2019, MSDC entered our 3rd year of the Establishment Project.  Each year, the amount of Establishment Project contribution is reduced and will end at the conclusion of year 4.

<h4 class="subheader" id="employment">COMMUNITY EMPLOYMENT SERVICES</h4>
MSDC is in the 3rd year of a four year contract in which we receive assistance with staff wages from the Establishment Project.  We are grateful that the Establishment Project has helped fund our supported employment program and I am happy to report that we are beginning to see increases in referrals over the past year.

In FY'2018, 55 Individuals were served in Marshall-Starke Development Center's Community Employment Services. The majority of individuals were residents of Marshall and Starke County, followed by Fulton County.
