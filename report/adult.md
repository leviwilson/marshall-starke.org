<h4 class="subheader" id="supported">SUPPORTED LIVING</h4>
In April we hired a new staff. Her title is Residential Habilitation Services (RHS) Evening Supervisor. This supervisor will work some evenings every week to observe at the Residential sites. She will be able to troubleshoot for consumers and Direct Support Professional (DSP) staff. She will also be completing monthly environmental checks for safety, observe medication passes to be sure DSP staff are following procedure, check smoke alarms and address any issues that need attention. RHS Evening Supervisor is also responsible for staffing scheduling shifts and is on call 24/7.

We have had three (3) new consumers join our Supported Living Program in the last year. We are happy to have current openings available.

In August we began transferring RHS consumers from Day Services to our Residential/Supported Living Program. This brought our numbers to 27. Our consumers live in residential sites either alone, sharing a house with peers or in the family home. We offer staff support to meet the consumers needs and budget. We will continue to transfer RHS consumers to this program.

We have also been looking forward to some reorganization in our Supported Living sites. There have been a few consumer changes in the last year and we want to be sure each consumer is living in a home that best suits their needs and also gives them the opportunity to live with different peers if they don't currently have a good match.

We have been struggling to hire and obtain DSP staff for several months. Recently we have hired several new staff and have been able to fill numerous shifts.

We were able to have our Summer Camp again this year. The location was at Tippecanoe State Park. Most of our RHS and Supported Living consumers attend this and spend a couple of nights in the cabins we rent. This is always a highlight of our summer. Other campers attend camps such as Camp Millhouse, ReYoAd and Camp Red Cedar. New friends are made and old relationships rekindled.

We work hard to give our consumers many different opportunities. In the past year, consumers have attended the following events: Turkey Tracks Hunt, Colts Game, Niles Scream Park, Cupcakes and Canvas class, News Boys Concert at Morris Civic, Cavalcade of Wheels, toured a Brewery, Potawatomi Zoo, MSDC/FOP Prom at the Moose, Residential Christmas Dinner Party, attended the Blueberry Festival, Fireman's Festival, Wizard of Oz play, Apple Orchard tour, 42nd Street play at the Century Center, Red Bud Trail event, Mentone Egg Festival, and saw Great White and Dokken Concert.

We look forward to another eventful year!

<h4 class="subheader" id="crossroads">COMMUNITY CROSSROADS</h4>
Community Crossroads has had a an amazing year in the new Pod setting. Currently, 243 consumers are being served. There does seem to be a trend with individuals choosing part-time group schedules and electing to have one-on-one services in their plans. We are happy to offer our consumers a variety of options to meet to the consumer's individual needs. Our consumers enjoy Group Community outings, which is a great time to volunteer and give back to the communities in which they live as well as participation in meaningful social outings with peers. Our year of extra-curricular events included the Annual Camping Trip in August, the fall party in October and our annual prom in May. These events are very important to the consumers that we serve. Facility Based Groups are provided daily by 5 trainers. Each day, consumers have approximately 16 Facility Based choices of groups which they may attend. Facility based groups are learning opportunities that assist our consumers in developing new skills as well as retaining old skills. In Plymouth, our transportation routes have increased.

Our Senior Program has been a big success. It has been open for nearly two years! The consumers that have chosen to be placed in the program have been very happy and if any openings have arisen, they have been quickly filled by consumers wishing to increase days in that classroom.

<h4 class="subheader" id="employment">COMMUNITY EMPLOYMENT SERVICES</h4>
In Fiscal Year 2015, 52 individuals were served in Marshall-Starke Development Center's Community Employment Services. The majority of individuals were residents of Marshall and Fulton Counties, followed closely by Starke County. There were a small number of St Joseph and LaPorte County residents served. The majority of program participants were in either their twenties or forties, while a smaller percentage were in their thirties. There was an even smaller number of individuals in the age ranges of fifties, sixties, and seventies.

There were 15 individuals placed in jobs this year. Of those individuals, eleven ended in successful closures through Vocational Rehabilitation. The four not ending in successful closures either quit their jobs or were terminated. Of the fifteen placements this fiscal year, seven of them were at businesses that had never hired from MSDC's Community Employment Services. Staff are always excited when a new door is opened to them.
