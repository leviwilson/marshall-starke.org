Summer Camp is happening in June this year!  Consumer’s chose Camp Millhouse or Camp Re-Yo-Ad for a week.  In August all consumers interested attended Camp Millhouse with MSDC staff for three days.  Staff and Consumers walked in the Blueberry parade.  Consumers look forward to carnival food and booths to shop.  Residential had their annual Christmas party.  Consumers always enjoy the food, drinks and exchanging gifts.

Residential had two consumers leave the program.  One went to a nursing home for end of life care and another moved back into parents’ home.  Currently all of residential sites are full with happy, healthy individuals.

At the beginning of spring our maintenance man began to do work around the Seven Supported Living Sites.  The homes have been power washed, built and repaired ramps, trimmed trees and bushes, cleaned gutters and completed inside repairs.  This is completed every spring, summer and fall.

Currently this program is short ten staff positions.  Our current staff have been working hard to help fill these shortages.  COVID has caused Havoc since March 2020.  All of our consumers have been nervous about the changes coming.  Consumers and staff started wearing masks, social distancing, washing our hand more frequently and staying home.  Consumers are nervous with all the changes and their parents are also concerned.  Consumers and staff have found been able to enjoy activities like cookouts, walks and friends/peers; playing basketball in the park, board games, rodeo, reading, social media, and watching TV.  Families have been cautious of taking their children home for weekends and holidays due to COVID.  We are all wondering where this is going to take us and how long we need to isolate.  We will be sure to celebrate Direct Support Professional (DSP) week with a lot of fun things.

Adult Programs here at MSDC has had a challenging year with the Covid-19 Pandemic.  Our attendance has been and continues to be affected by the pandemic.  MSDC did have a closure for Day Programs and we re-opened 8-7-2021.  Consumer attendance has trickled slowly back to normal.  Many of our staff were infected with Covid-19,  as well as some consumers.  Staff were offered vaccines in January of 2021 and consumers were offered the vaccine in March. 

Pre-Covid-19, each year, we have several social events for the individuals we serve, a prom in May, a 3-day camping trip, and two fall parties.  There are many outside donors and families that help make these events happy and memorable occasions for those we serve and we truly appreciate their assistance.  Unfortunately, during the Pandemic, we were unable to offer these annual events and hope to have a party in the fall of 2021.  

Throughout the year, Adult Programs offer a variety of services, such as:  Prevocational, Group Facility (DHGM), Group Community (DHGS), Day Habilitation Individual, as well as Participant Active Care (PAC) and Respite.  For considerations of Covid-19, our consumers are placed in a small group with the same individuals a week at a time.  The next week, the consumers rotate to a different trainer and a different group of consumers. Consumers have been doing a great job advocating for which group they want to be in and with whom.  Our consumers participate in many meaningful activities with a focus on volunteerism, exercise, social activities and daily living skills.

MSDC’s Rochester site, Manitou Training Center (MTC) also offers a full range of services.  MTC is a smaller facility, with an enrollment of 36 individuals.  MTC has also had a slight gain in enrollment over the past year, with an increase of 3 consumers. There are some consumers that appreciate the smaller environment in Rochester, so we do offer transportation to/from Rochester daily for consumers that choose to attend services at MTC.  We do try to meld the consumers from both agencies at times throughout the year, creating one big, happy family! 

MSDC is proud to continue to offer piece rate work to our consumers in Pre-vocational Services through our Department of Labor 14C Certificate.  Piece rate work that is obtained from contracted work through area companies is another way to encourage choice for our consumers in earning a paycheck in an environment that they prefer.  Due to WIOA legislation, some consumers under the age of 24 may not be eligible to earn a paycheck unless certain restrictions have been met.   

We are pleased to be able to provide door-to-door transportation to/from our centers for individuals living in Starke, Marshall and Fulton Counties.  We also offer pick-up-points for those that live outside of those counties.  Many consumers are utilizing those pick-up-points from St. Joseph, LaPorte and Kosciusko counties.  Each year since 2014, MSDC has applied for, and received INDOT grants that pay 80% of the cost of new vehicles.  In the 2020 INDOT Grant, MSDC was awarded 3 new vehicles.  Because of the Pandemic, INDOT offered two additional  vans for purchase as the prior agencies that were awarded the vans were unable to purchase the vehicles.  MSDC was very fortunate and happy to purchase the two vehicles for the 20% match.  For the next cycle of INDOT vehicles, INDOT has announced that the 20% match will be waived due to an increase in funding.  The INDOT grants have made a tremendous improvement in the safety and reliability of our fleet of 34 vehicles, all used daily to meet the needs of individuals with disabilities. 

MSDC offers Employment Services to individuals with disabilities that are seeking community employment.  Current enrollment in this program is 25 individuals.  Our two Employment Services staff’s goals are to prepare, obtain and retain work for individuals in community jobs.  Most consumers will need on the job supports for a period of time, and then perhaps a small amount of follow-along support after the person is stabilized in a job. In 2016, MSDC applied for, and received the Establishment Project, which is a four-year financial assistance program developed by Vocational Rehabilitation to assist agencies increase the quality, quantity and intensity of employment services.  The finances from the Establishment Project enabled MSDC to promote one employment staff and hire an additional staff for Employment Services.  The Establishment Grant will end in spring of 2020. Since 2016, our enrollment has fluctuated between 20-26 enrollees.  Due to the Covid-19 Pandemic, the way the Employment Services are provided has changed and become more flexible to meet the need of the individuals enrolled as well as employers, while maintaining safety and limiting Covid-19 exposures. 

<h4 class="subheader" id="employment">COMMUNITY EMPLOYMENT SERVICES</h4>
MSDC is in the 4th year of a four-year contract in which we receive assistance with staff wages from the Establishment Project.  We are grateful that the Establishment Project has helped fund our supported employment program and I am happy to report that we are beginning to see increases in referrals over the past year.

In FY’ 2020, 59 individuals were served in Marshall-Starke Development Center’s Community Employment Services.  The majority of individuals were residents of Marshall and Starke County, followed by Fulton County.
