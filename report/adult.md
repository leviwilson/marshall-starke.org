<h4 class="subheader" id="supported">SUPPORTED LIVING</h4>
The Supported Living Program gained two new male residents who moved into a new handicap accessible home with two other roommates. We had a consumer pass away in July 2015 that left an opening for a new resident. This was a sad time for our consumers. We had several falls with broken bones this year. Our residents are aging having difficulty with mobility. We are seeing more walking aids implemented. Consumers have been to Deep River Water, attended the local 411 Fairs, carnivals, museums, zoo, wrestling, parades, miniature golf, bowling, Special Olympic tournaments and festivals. Residential consumers took part in the FOP/Futures/MSDC three day Summer Camp Out in September, attend the MSDC/FOP Prom, Harvest Ball, Fall Dance at the Moose Lodge. We always have birthday celebrations for consumer's birthdays. The birthday person choose what they want to do and who they want to invite. They go bowling, pizza parties, campfire celebrations, Game Stop, etc. Supported Living had its own Christmas Party at the Lions Club in Rochester. It is a big event with lost of food, drinks, gifts and fun! Consumers have taken an interest in decorating their homes this year! They have been to the mall to shop for items to hang on the walls, some new furniture, curtains, bedding and fun things to fit their personalities. Our Supported Living consumers are also working on goals to learn to be more independent in their homes and communities. Several consumers have boyfriend/girlfriends who they go to movies and out to dinner with.

Community Crossroads program participant numbers have been growing by leaps and bounds! Many consumers have been receiving the FSW as a funding source. which has allowed them to choose MSDC as their provider. Consumers have choices daily that include pre-vocational training and the opportunity to earn a paycheck while learning valuable work skills Consumers may also choose groups in the facility with two trainers that are dedicated to provide facility based groups Classes may be academic in nature or address one of many subjects in our curriculum. Examples could be computer groups, cooking groups, sports activities, exercise or other specific groups to address consumer needs. There are various solicalization groups that occur daily. Consumers also have the option of attending group community outings each day. MSDC provides many hours of volunteer work to area agencies such as Meals on Wheels, Food Pantries, United Way, Older Adult Services, as well as many other non-profit entities. Consumers may also choose meaningful activities such as bingo. bowling, swimming, museum groups. picnics, walking or socialization groups in the community. These groups change every few months to accommodate the changing of seasons Another service we offer to consumers is individual habilitation services Most consumers have some funds in their budgets to receive time spent one-on-one with a trainer. Goals are developed to address a person's needs and the trainer works either in the community or the facility to enhance a consumers abilities in the goal area. A person's day is driven by a consumer's whishes and is decided each morning when they arrive. The daily schedule can have a vanety of serves each day. providing many choices for each consumer, depending on how they wish to spend their day Some consumers have time built Into their budgets to receive PAC or Respite. These sevices are usually utilitied in the evening or on weekends. Consumers recleving these services choose what they would like to do with their trainer. It may be an evening home while parents or guardians have some away time or the consumer may choose to go to a movie and out to eat.

Each year. we offer consumers three extra-curricular activities. In the spring, we have a well attended prom. MSDC collects dress attire for any of those that need clothing to wear. We have been fortunate to have donations of jewelry and prom decorations from area businesses that add to the nuance of the evening Each fall, consumers attend a dance The preparation for these parties are all part of the fun and consumers help each step of the way. For the past two years, we have affered a camping trip to consumers at a very low cost. This year. our trip was held at Tippecanoe State Park where we stayed in "rustic" cabins Our consumers and staff made many wonderful memories, and had a great deal of fun with friends We hope to make this camping trip part of our annual traditions.

The Industrial Track is a choice for consumers who wish to have an emphasis on learning work skills. There are job options that give the consumer the opportunity to enhance a large variety of work skills while earning a paycheck.
