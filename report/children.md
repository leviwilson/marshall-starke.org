<h4 class="subheader" id="early-childhood">EARLY CHILDHOOD VOCATIONAL EDUCATION</h4>
Last year marked the 14th year of our collaboration with the North Central Area Vocational Cooperative and Ivy Tech College to offer junior and senior high school students a professional pathway for Early Childhood Education.  Upon successful completion of the two-year program the students earn 12 transferrable college credits and a Child Development Associate (CDA) credential.  Last year 32 students from five area high schools participated in the programs.

<h4 class="subheader" id="parent-involvement">PARENT INVOLVEMENT AND FAMILY ENGAGEMENT</h4>
The programs offered a variety of in-person parent meetings before transitioning to virtual parent engagement.  In-person engagement events included a four-part series on Adult Resiliency conducted by our licensed Mental Health Consultant.  Other in-person family engagement activities included a nature walk, block party, book exchange, Reading with Dad, and Chocolate and Canvas for Moms.  Beginning in March the Family Resource Workers maintained ongoing contact with families by telephone, text, email, Face-Time, and drive-byes.

Every Head Start and Early Head Start family is assigned a Family Resource Worker (FSW).  The FSW possesses an extensive knowledge of community resources to link families with needed services.  The FRW uses a strength base approach, respectful and sensitive to diverse family lifestyles and systems, to facilitate parent engagement.  Head Start is the only two generational-program serving both the child and parent in the attainment of goals to promote well-being.  So often, the FSW serves as a critical source for support and comfort when crisis occurs.  An example of this critical support involved a Head Start mom confiding to her FRW that her husband told her to move out of their residence and to take the children with her.  The mom was panic stricken and on the brink of homelessness in the midst of the pandemic.  The FRW linked her with our community partners namely the Red Cross, Marshall County Trustee, Bowen Center and Marshall County Neighborhood Center for food, housing assistance and mental health services.  Fast forward to present time and the mom reports the couple have reunited and the children are doing well in school.

<h4 class="subheader" id="child-outcome-data">CHILD OUTCOME DATA</h4>
We looked at child outcome and school readiness data for Head Start Children eligible for a second year.  We wondered if the change from in-person to E-Learning in March 2020 resulted in learning loss.  The data shows that 95% of the returning children experienced no learning loss.  This commendable finding speaks to the commitment and expertise of our teachers to support children’s development and engage parents in their children’s learning.

The third and last child outcome data checkpoint was completed in early March 2020 shortly before cancellation of in-person classes.  All enrolled Head Start and Early Head Start children made outstanding progress evidenced by on-going assessment data.  A comparison of data from the previous year with last year showed three times the number of Head Start children mastering alphabet recognition.  Intentionality of instruction may help to explain the outstanding outcome.  Teachers doubled down and intentionally focused on instructional activities and methods to rev-up letter recognition skill development; a critical precursor skill for reading.

The final EHS outcome data checkpoint showed all children meeting age expectation across all developmental areas with the exception of one child with an IFSP.

<h4 class="subheader" id="average-attendance">HEAD START/EARLY HEAD START ENROLLMENT AND AVERAGE ATTENDANCE</h4>
The 2019 Annual Report captures on-going monitoring data to report patterns and trends.  The Head Start and Early Head Start programs maintained full enrollment throughout the 2019-2020 school year even when services transitioned to remote delivery.  Enrolled children receiving remote services were considered present and off-site for reporting purposes.  The average Head Start attendance for the year was 92%.

Head Start’s funded enrollment is 148 children ages three to five years of age.  Funded enrollment for Early Head Start is 40 infants and toddlers inclusive of pregnant women.  The culminative enrollment totaled 252 children zero to five years of age.  The program served 29% of the eligible children zero to five years of age residing in the service area.

The **Annual Audit** reported no concerns.

**Health Outcomes**
All children’s health records are maintained electronically.  Therefore, we can readily retrieve date from previous program years.  By March 2020, prior to the stay-at-home order, 95% of children’s physicals were completed; 89% of dentals were completed and 99% of immunizations were determined to be up-to-date.:w
