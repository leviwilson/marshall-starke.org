## C.E.O.'s Chat
Where has the year gone? Fiscal year 2017 I celebrated one year as CEO. Mike and I worked to make the transition a smooth one. The past year has been challenging, but rewarding.

The staffing crisis, which is affecting all agencies across Indiana, has been our largest obstacle. We still don't have the answers, but are hopeful the Direct Support Professional wage increase approved by our State legislatures will bring some relief.

I look forward to 2018 and to forging head first into our agency goals and objectives.
