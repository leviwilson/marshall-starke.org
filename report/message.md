## C.E.O.'s Chat
Where did another year go? I can’t believe I have been your CEO for three years already, and have loved
every day! Our fiscal year 2018 was, as usual, a busy one. We joined our trade association, INARF, in
advocating for a Medicaid Waiver rate increase to increase Direct Support Professional (DSP) wages.
Indiana legislators approved a $20,000,000 per year increase in Medicaid funding to increase rates 5%.
Agencies were mandated to pass 75% of the increased revenue through to DSPs. MSDC used the other
25% to help pay increased taxes and other DSP benefits. We expect INARF to begin another campaign in
2019 to increase rates to enable all agencies to increase DSPs’ base wage. MSDC will advocate for our
DSPs in this essential request as MSDC continues to struggle to find good DSP candidates.

All of Marshall-Starke’s programs continued to evolve and grow this year. Enrollment in our Day
Services increased this year, but we also lost some old friends, which is always hard for both consumers
and staff. Our Supported Living program maintained enrollment, but there was a large project in this
program this year. MSDC sold the house we owned in Rochester that used to be our old group home.
We purchased a duplex, and it didn’t take our maintenance man very long to tear down the wall between
the two units. Our maintenance man worked hard to turn the property into a beautiful home for our
Rochester residents. Headstart moved classrooms around, and were welcomed into the Bremen Schools
with open arms. MSDC is working to lengthen the school day for 4 year old preschoolers for the next
school year. Early Headstart continued to provide quality home based services. MSDC’s Vocational
Childhood Education class enrollment increased this year. Staff was able to offer their years of life
experiences in Childhood Education to 30 students.

Consumers and staff look forward to what Fiscal Year 2019 holds for all of us at Marshall-Starke
Development Center!
