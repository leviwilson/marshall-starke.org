## C.E.O. Message
Fiscal year 2020:  What a year!  MSDC certainly was not prepared or expecting a COVID 19 pandemic.  MSDC closed on March 19, 2020 for about three weeks.  When I say the management, team worked every day to ensure we were doing everything possible to keep things running as smoothly as possible.

MSDC was awarded a $822,000.00 PPP loan thanks to First Source Bank.  The entire loan was forgiven, which was a life saver for the agency.  The PPP loan covered employee wages so n staff had to be laid off.  Children’s Services was the recipient of several Head Start grants, and Adult Services also received grants from the State of Indiana

Adult Programs continued to have difficulty hiring staff particularly in our Supported Living Program.  We tried new means to recruit, but with limited success.  Staff having to quarantine only complicated our situation.  At some point, in time, that program had 8-10 open positions. 

When the fiscal year ended, Adult Services was back up and running, and Children’s Services was planning for a successful return at the end of summer.  We were very lucky in that no employee or program participant was critically ill with COVID.

We hope there will be light at the end of the tunnel with a new State budget in FY2022.
