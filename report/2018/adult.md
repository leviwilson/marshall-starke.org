<h4 class="subheader" id="supported">SUPPORTED LIVING</h4>
In the past year, we lost one consumer due to death, two consumers exited the program to move home with family and we gained one new consumer in Rochester and another in Plymouth.  One consumer had new community employment and then lost his position.

We sold MSDC’s Sunset Drive site in 11/2017 and moved into our new site on ManChester Drive in 01/2018. This was a great move for our consumers. They are enjoying their new home with all the amenities to make life comfortable and the home requires only minimal maintenance.

Staffing in Supported Living has continued to increase and decrease from as few as four DSP’s needed and as many as ten DSP’s needed at any given time. This seems to be an ongoing issue we have been unable to solve. We advertise on INDEED and FACEBOOK and in local newspapers. Supervisors have attended trainings on “Dealing with Difficult Employees” to “Creating a Full House”; we have increased starting wages, we are flexible with hours offered and still cannot hire enough staff.

We had five consumers attend a summer camp of their choice. They always enjoy seeing old friends and making new connections. MSDC had our camp
out and all was great. This is a good activity for consumers that don’t attend a community summer camp. Lots of fun was had!

Our current RHS Evening Supervisor resigned and we began the search for a new supervisor.

<h4 class="subheader" id="crossroads">COMMUNITY CROSSROADS</h4>
In the Community Crossroads Program, we did receive two new vans through the INDOT Grant. It is wonderful to receive these grants, which pays for the cost of two vehicles, less our 20% match.  We did complete an INDOT review which yielded no citations! We also completed our CARF review in May.  We did receive a three year accreditation.  The preparation was grueling but it turned out well for our agency.  We had a successful annual camping trip at Camp Millhouse in South Bend with over 65 overnight guests.  This is the perfect site for our annual three day camping trip and we will continue to rent this property annually. We applied for the Day Program Grant and have been awarded $49,433.10 from the State of Indiana to complete renovations on the consumer restrooms, which is greatly needed.  Our enrollment for Day Program has remained steady.  We do see a trend with consumers requesting more Individual Services and less full-time Day Services.

Manitou Training Center offers a range of community and facility based groups to participate in, as well as individualized services. Currently, 32 consumers are being served. Community volunteer groups are available each day. These give consumers a chance to expand their community knowledge, pre-vocational skills, and a sense of accomplishment in helping their community. Other community groups are focused on community resources where consumers can choose laundry, recycling, supply shopping, exercise, and leisure activities to attend and learn through experiencing and participation.   Facility based groups include a mix of technology classes, basic concepts, pre-vocational, exercise, cooking, music, art, local news, learning about other cultures, social skills, and academic skills for various individual’s needs. Each of these groups are offered on a weekly bases so that consumers are giving an opportunity to explore different interests and expand their knowledge.

In 2018, the exterior of the building was painted with the funds raised from the Non-Event-Event. The landscape around the building was updated and landscape rock installed. Ipads and keyboards were purchased for the technology classes from the Rob Wilson Memorial Fund.

<h4 class="subheader" id="employment">COMMUNITY EMPLOYMENT SERVICES</h4>
MSDC is in the 3rd year of a four year contract in which we receive assistance with staff wages from the Establishment Project.  We are grateful that the Establishment Project has helped fund our supported employment program and I am happy to report that we are beginning to see increases in referrals over the past year.

In FY'2018, 55 Individuals were served in Marshall-Starke Development Center's Community Employment Services. The majority of individuals were residents of Marshall and Starke County, followed by Fulton County.
