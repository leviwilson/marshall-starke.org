## C.E.O. Message
As I reflect on Fiscal Year 2019, the number of dedicated employees who make Marshall-Starke operate on a daily basis is amazing.  We currently employ 176 thoughtful, caring part- and full-time employees that make my job doable.  Whether working with children in Early Headstart/Headstart or working with individuals with disabilities in Community Crossroads/Employment Services their commitment is unwavering.

This year 235 children were served in Early Headstart and Headstart by 55 of those exceptional employees who helped children master school readiness goals.  Thirty high school students were mentored by two teachers and numerous classroom educators as they prepared for a career in Early Childhood Education.

In Adult Programs 121 explementary employees encouraged 257 individuals to experience a variety of life adventures.  Securing his/her first job, mastering daily living skills, developing meaningful relationships, exploring hobbies and interests, or volunteering at other non-profits were all facilitated by committed staff.

This year MSDC had a goal to attract and retain a quality work force that personifies the stated values of the agency.  Managementâ€™s action steps to meet this goal were to restructure the orientation process, enhance communication across all programs, and improve professional development.  The goal and the action steps help MSDC retain the extraordinary people who give of themselves every day.

We look forward to moving our mission into 2020!
