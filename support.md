## Support Us
Long-term financial stability is an ever present concern of not-for-profits; we are no exception. Support from community organizations, businesses, and individuals is vital to the continued offering of quality programs to the vulnerable population we serve.

As federal and state funding have tightened over the years, community support has become even more important. Your donations help to ensure that the services we provide will be available in our community for many years to come.

### Endowment Fund
Many years ago, we established an Endowment Fund with the Marshall County Community Foundation. Contributions or bequests can be made to the endowment fund in our name or directly to Marshall-Starke Development Center. When making a direct contribution, you may designate a program to receive your donation or allow us to use it where we have the greatest need.

Contributions directly to Marshall-Starke or to our Endowment Fund are tax deductible in accordance with state and federal regulations.
